### A
<dl>
  <dt>Artificial organ</dt>
  <dd>An engineered device that can be implanted or integrated into a human body to replace a natural organ, to duplicate or improve a specific function.  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Autoimmune Disease</dt>
  <dd>A disease type in which the immune system can’t differentiate between its own cells and those which have invaded the body.</dd>
</dl>

### B
<dl>
  <dt>Benign Tumor</dt>
  <dd>A collection of abnormal non-cancerous tissue cells that can grow uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Bioengineering</dt>
  <dd>The use of engineering principles and techniques in the biomedical world to develop prostheses, organs, and medical devices and instruments. Also called biomedical engineering.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Bioinformatics</dt>
  <dd>An interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software to understand a collection of biological data in research.</dd>
</dl>

### D
<dl>
  <dt>Digital Health</dt>
  <dd>The concept of providing medical treatments and information using technology.</dd>
</dl>

### E
<dl>
  <dt>Environmental toxicology</dt>
  <dd>A scientific field that studies the harmful effects of various chemical, biological and physical environmental toxins in the environment on living organisms.</dd>
</dl>

### G
<dl>
  <dt>Genetic engineering</dt>
  <dd>The scientific modification and manipulation of an organism's structural genetic makeup, RNA or DNA, using technology.</dd>
</dl>

### I
<dl>
  <dt>Immunosuppressants</dt>
  <dd>A type of medication that weakens the immune system's response to foreign matter. Immunosuppressants prevent the body's immune system from attacking organs that it may not recognize as belonging to itself, such as after an organ transplant.</dd>
</dl>

### M
<dl>
  <dt>Metastasis</dt>
  <dd>The process of a pathogen spreading from the initial area to a secondary area.</dd>
  <dt>Microbiology</dt>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Malignant tumor</dt>
  <dd>A collection of abnormal cancerous tissue cells that can grow uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues.</dd>
<dl>
  
<dl>  
  <dt>Meiosis</dt>
  <dd>A type of cell division in sexually reproducing organism that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.</dd>
</dl>

### P

<dl>
  <dt>Psychopharmacogenetics</dt>
  <dd>A field that investigates the relationships between genetics and a person’s to a psychiatric drug.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Pharmacogenomics</dt>
  <dd>A field of research that studies how an individual's DNA affects their response to medication.</dd>
</dl>

### R
  
<dl>
  <dt>Radiomics</dt>
  <dd>A field of research applies data mining to medical imagery. This field focuses on pulling large amounts of quantitative data from images by using data  characterization algorithms. By using data analysis and machine learning, applications can find tumors and other areas of concern faster and with better accuracy than humans.</dd>
</dl>

### T
  
<dl>  
  <dt>Tissue Culture (TC) Technology</dt>
  <dd>Technology that cultivates a plant's cell, organ and tissue growth, in multiple mediums under controlled conditions.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Tissue engineering</dt>
  <dd>A field that uses the principles of engineering and biology to develop biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve tissue function.</dd>
</dl> 

<dl>
  <dt>Transgenic Method</dt>
  <dd>A type of experimentation where DNA segments of one organism are introduced to another.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Transgenic organisms:</dt>
  <dd>A gene from one organism is incorporated into the genome of another organism to alter the existing gene by artificial means.  </dd>
</dl>
