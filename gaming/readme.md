## A
<dl>
<dt>	Asset	</dt>	
   <dd>	An asset is any data file used in a game, as opposed to code. For example, images, sound or music files, 3D models (i.e., characters or environments), and dialog.   	</dd>
</dl>

## C
<dl>
<dt>	Collision	</dt>	
   <dd>	In a video game, a collision occurs when two or more objects intersect, interact with, or come into the proximity of one another within a certain threshold. 	</dd>

<dt>	Game Design Document (GDD)	</dt>	
   <dd>	A game design document, or GDD, is a dynamic and detailed planning document, usually created by game developers or a development team. It is used in the early stages of game development as part of a pitch or shortly after the game is commissioned by a game publisher. The GDD guides the development team as they work together to build the game and is generally considered a "living document" that changes as development progesses. It describes the game's concept, technical design, user interface, artwork and story elements, as well as target audience and selling points. </dd>

<dt>	Game Engine	</dt>	
   <dd> A game engine is a suite of software tools for video game developers, often provided in an integrated development environment. Tools and features vary across game engines but generally include graphics rendering, a physics engine, artifical intelligence capabilities, and sound as well as animation engines. Game engine software's pre-built framework supports faster, more efficient game development.   </dd>
