### A
<dl>
  <dt>Autoimmune Disease</dt>
  <dd>A disease type in which the immune system canâ€™t differentiate between its own cells and those which have invaded the body.</dd>
</dl>

### B
<dl>
  <dt>Benign Tumor</dt>
  <dd>A collection of abnormal non-cancerous tissue cells that can grow uncontrollably and invade nearby tissues.</dd>
</dl>

### D
<dl>
  <dt>Digital Health</dt>
  <dd>The concept of providing medical treatments and information using technology.</dd>
</dl> 

### I
<dl>
  <dt>Immunosuppressants</dt>
  <dd>A type of medication that weakens the immune system's response to foreign matter. Immunosuppressants prevent the body's immune system from attacking organs that it may not recognize as belonging to itself, such as after an organ transplant.</dd>
</dl>

### M
<dl>
  <dt>Metastasis</dt>
  <dd>The process of a pathogen spreading from the initial area to a secondary area.</dd>
  <dt>Microbiology</dt>
  <dd>The scientific study of living organisms that are too small to be seen by the human eye.</dd>
</dl>

### P
<dl>
  <dt>Pharmacogenomics</dt>
  <dd>A field of research that studies how an individual's DNA affects their response to medication.
</dd>
</dl>

### R
<dl>
  <dt>Radiomics</dt>
  <dd>a field of research that tries to extract large amounts of quantitative data from images by using data characterization algorithms.</dd>
</dl>


### T
<dl>
  <dt>transgenic method</dt>
  <dd>A type of experimentation where DNA segments of one organism are introduced to another.</dd>
  <dt>Tissue Culture (TC) Technology</dt>
  <dd>Technology that cultivates a plant's cell, organ and tissue growth, in multiple mediums under controlled conditions.</dd>
</dl>
